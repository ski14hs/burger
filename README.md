Express and handlebars Burger tracker

A simple app that is deployed on Heroku at:
https://floating-reef-14666.herokuapp.com/

It uses express and handlebars to server up a simple HTML page that displays burgers on a MySQL database connected by npm mysql and JawsDB on Heroku.

Once on the page a list of Burgers is displayed with a button to eat the burger. Burgers eaten will be displayed in a lower section.
Below that is a simple form to add new burgers to the database.
